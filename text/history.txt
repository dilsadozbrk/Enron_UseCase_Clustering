The Enron scandal was an accounting scandal involving Enron Corporation, 
an American energy company based in Houston, Texas. Upon being publicized in October 2001,
the company declared bankruptcy and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen – then one of 
the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world – was effectively dissolved.
    
In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history at that time, 
Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure

Enron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, Lay developed a staff of executives 
that – by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial 
reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. 
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives misled Enron's board of directors 
and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices and pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore
the issues.

Enron shareholders filed a $40 billion lawsuit after the company's stock price, 
which achieved a high of US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 by the end
of November 2001.[2] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation,
and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price.
 
The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the 
United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate 
bankruptcy in U.S. history until the WorldCom scandal the following year.[3]

Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced
to prison, including Lay and Skilling. Arthur Andersen was found guilty of illegally destroying 
documents relevant to the SEC investigation, which voided its license to audit public companies 
and effectively closed the firm. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Arthur Andersen had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees 
and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock 
prices. The executives all were charged with a felony after the allegations.

As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the 
accuracy of financial reporting for public companies.[4] One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes–Oxley 
Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or 
for attempting to defraud shareholders.[5] The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms
