What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \\nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \\non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \\nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \\nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \\ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \\nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \\narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \\nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \\nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \\nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \\nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \\nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \\nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \\nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \\nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \\nproject.\\n\\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \\ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \\nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\\n\\nRichard  \\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \\n08:34 AM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nAllan Severude\\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \\nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\\n\\n\\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \\npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \\nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \\ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \\nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \\nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\\n\\nThings left to do:\\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \\nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \\nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \\nproject and which fall out of scope.\\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \\nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \\ndrill downs.\\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\\n\\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \\nticker.\\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \\nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \\ntransport, swaps, options, ...\\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \\nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \\nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \\nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \\nappropriate positions to show for each:\\nGas Daily for monthly index,\\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \\nusing official valuations.\\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \\nskew and correlations.\\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \\nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \\ngamma grid.\\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \\nmanager.\\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \\nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \\nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\\nDeployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit \\nand explicit position break out issues.\\n\\n-- Allan.\\n\\nPS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \\ntransport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \\npoint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
