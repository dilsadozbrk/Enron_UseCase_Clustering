## Global Roadmap

| Data Selection | Data Pre-processing | Clustering | Visualization |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Choose relevant folders and parts of emails to focus on | Email content to be cleaned & identify unique keywords | K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering & Topic Modelling | Dropdowns for high-level and low-level topics |
| Result: csv with raw info | Result: matrix containing unique keywords | Result: features/topics and resulting emails | Result: Relevant emails displayed to user based on topic selection


### MVP
1. Selecting an appropriate algorithm
2. Split dataset into chunks
3. High-level topics → displayed on command line (later iterations → sub-topics + streamlit)

### Daily Roadmap
Day 1 → Goal: Data Exploration + Initial Experimentation
- [X] Convert all email files into one raw csv - Dilsad and Aditya
